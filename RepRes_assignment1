## Loading and preprocessing the data
Read the data file 'activity.csv'
convert date from factor format to date format 'ymd
remove all rows where steps data is NA

``` { r, echo = TRUE }
activity <- read.csv('~/desktop/activity.csv')
activity$date <- ymd(as.Date(as.character(activity$date)))
activity <- filter(activity, !is.na(activity$steps) )
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of 
steps taken per day

``` { r, echo = TRUE }
dailysteps <- activity %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(sum(steps))
names(dailysteps)[2] <- 'totalsteps'


hist(dailysteps$totalsteps, freq = NULL, axes = T, 
           main ='steps taken every day', xlab =' Daily steps')


mediandailysteps <- summary(dailysteps$totalsteps)[3]
meandailysteps <- summary(dailysteps$totalsteps)[4]
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
