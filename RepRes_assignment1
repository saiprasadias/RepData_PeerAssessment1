## Loading and preprocessing the data
Read the data file 'activity.csv'
convert date from factor format to date format 'ymd


``` { r, echo = TRUE }
actv <- read.csv('~/desktop/activity.csv')
actv$date <- ymd(as.Date(as.character(actv$date)))
a<- actv
actv <- filter(actv, !is.na(steps) )
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of 
steps taken per day

``` { r, echo = TRUE }
dailysteps <- actv %>% group_by(date) %>% 
                summarise(totalsteps = sum(steps))
hist(dailysteps$totalsteps, freq = NULL, axes = T, 
           main ='steps taken every day', xlab =' Daily steps')
mediandailysteps <- summary(dailysteps$totalsteps)[3]
meandailysteps <- summary(dailysteps$totalsteps)[4]
print(c('Mean Daily Steps =', meandailysteps))
print(c('Median Daily Steps =', mediandailysteps))
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
Make a time series plot ("type="l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) 
and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, 
contains the maximum number of steps?

``` { r, echo = TRUE }
stp_int <- actv %>% group_by(interval) %>% 
                           summarise(avg_steps =  mean(steps) )

plot(stp_int$interval, stp_int$avg_steps, 
     type = 'l', xlab = 'intervals', ylab = 'Average Steps', 
     main = 'Average steps over the day')

mint <- stp_int %>% 
          filter(avg_steps == max(avg_steps) )
print(c("The Interval in which Max steps are taken = ", mint[1]) )
```

## Imputing missing values
Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing 
values (coded as NA).
Calculate and report the total number of missing values (i.e. NAs)

actv <- a
missingvals <- sum(is.na(actv$steps))
print(c("Total Missing Values", missingvals))

## Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. 
## you could use mean/median for that day/5-minute interval, etc.
## Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the 
## missing data filled in.

for (i in 1:dim(actv)[1]) {
     if (is.na(actv[i,1] ) )
     {
       const <- filter(stp_int, interval == actv[i,3])
       actv[i,1] <- const[1,2]
     } ## end of if
  
} ## End of for loop

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and 
Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken 
per day. 

dailysteps <- actv %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(sum(steps))
names(dailysteps)[2] <- 'totalsteps'
hist(dailysteps$totalsteps, freq = NULL, axes = T, 
     main ='steps taken every day', xlab =' Daily steps')
mediandailysteps <- summary(dailysteps$totalsteps)[3]
meandailysteps <- summary(dailysteps$totalsteps)[4]
print(c('Mean Daily Steps after replacement=', meandailysteps))
print(c('Median Daily Steps after replacement =', mediandailysteps))

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
